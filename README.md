# Attendance OTP System

This project implements an attendance management system using OTPs (One-Time Passwords) where teachers generate a code, and students enter the code to validate and mark their attendance. The OTP expires after 10 seconds to ensure secure and time-sensitive validation.

## Features
- **Teacher Role:** Teachers can generate OTPs for each class.
- **Student Role:** Students can enter the OTP to mark their attendance.
- **OTP Expiry:** The OTP expires after 10 seconds to ensure quick validation.
- **Security:** Time-sensitive OTP ensures that attendance cannot be manipulated.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or React)
- Backend: Node.js (Express or other frameworks)
- Database: MongoDB (for storing attendance data and OTPs)
- OTP Generation: `otp-generator` or any other suitable library
- Expiry Handling: Set timeout or expiration logic
- Authentication: Optional (can be integrated with JWT for secure user access)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js installed on your machine.
2. A MongoDB instance (either local or hosted).
3. OTP generation library (e.g., `otp-generator`).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/attendance-otp-system.git

   
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
